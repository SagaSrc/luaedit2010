The purpose of these sample projects are to demonstrate
how to debug using LuaEdit projects and solutions. However,
you could always decide to attach to a remote machine (or
the local one) and simply debug the software by manually
opening files inside LuaEdit and adding breakpoints to them.
Once those files would be executed in the software, LuaEdit
would break where breakpoints were added.

See the projects' ReadMe.txt file for more information.
